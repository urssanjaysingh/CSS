<!-- The <link> element can be used to include an external stylesheet file in your HTML document.
An external style sheet is a separate text file with .css extension. You define all the Style rules 
within this text file and then you can include this file in any HTML document using <link> element. -->

        <h1>This is External CSS</h1>

<!-- IMPORTED CSS: @import is used to import an external stylesheet in a manner similar to the
<link> element.

<!-- We have discussed four ways to include style sheet rules in an HTML document.
Here is the rule to override any Style Sheet Rule.
>> Any inline style sheet takes the highest priority. So, it will override any rule defined in 
    <style>...</style> tags or the rules defined in any external style sheet file. 

>> Any rule defined in <style>...</style> tags will override the rules defined in any external 
    style sheet file.

>> Any rule defined in the external style sheet file takes the lowest priority, and the rules defined 
in this file will be applied only when the above two rules are not applicable. -->
