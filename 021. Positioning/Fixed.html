<!-- Fixed positioning allows you to fix the position of an element to a particular spot
on the page, regardless of scrolling. Specified coordinates will be relative to the
browser window.
You can use two values top and left along with the position property to move an
HTML element anywhere in the HTML document.
>> Move Left - Use a negative value for left.
>> Move Right - Use a positive value for left.
>> Move Up - Use a negative value for top.
>> Move Down - Use a positive value for top.
NOTE: You can use bottom or right values as well in the same way as top and
left. -->
