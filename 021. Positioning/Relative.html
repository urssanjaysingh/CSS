<!-- Relative positioning changes the position of the HTML element relative to where
it normally appears. So "left:20" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position.
You can use two values top and left along with the position property to move an
HTML element anywhere in an HTML document.
>> Move Left - Use a negative value for left.
>> Move Right - Use a positive value for left.
>> Move Up - Use a negative value for top.
>> Move Down - Use a positive value for top.
NOTE: You can use the bottom or right values as well in the same way as top
and left. -->
