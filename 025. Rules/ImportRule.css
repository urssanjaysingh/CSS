/* The @import rule allows you to import styles from another style sheet. It should
appear right at the start of the style sheet before any of the rules, and its value
is a URL.

It can be written in one of the two following ways: */

@import "mystyle.css";

/* The significance of the @import rule is that it allows you to develop your style
