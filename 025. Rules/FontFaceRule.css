/* The @font-face rule is used to exhaustively describe a font face for use in a
document. @font-face may also be used to define the location of a font for
download, although this may run into implementation-specific limits.
In general, @font-face is extremely complicated, and its use is not
recommended for any except those who are expert in font metrics. */
