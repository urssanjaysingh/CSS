<!-- Outlines are very similar to borders, but there are few major differences as well:
An outline does not take up space.
Outlines do not have to be rectangular.
Outline is always the same on all sides; you cannot specify different
values for different sides of an element. 

The outline-width property specifies the width of the outline to be added to the
box. Its value should be a length or one of the values thin, medium, or thick,
just like the border-width attribute.
A width of zero pixels means no outline.
