<!-- CSS pseudo-elements are used to add special effects to some selectors. You do
not need to use JavaScript or any other script to use those effects. A simple
syntax of pseudo-element is as follows:
    selector: pseudo-element {property: value}
CSS classes can also be used with the pseudo-elements:
    selector. class: pseudo-element {property: value} -->

<!-- The following example demonstrates how to use the :first-line element to add
special effects to the first line of elements in a document. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <title>First Line Pseudo Element</title>
        <style type="text/css">
            p:first-line {
                text-decoration: underline;
            }

            p.noline:first-line {
                text-decoration: none;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <p class="noline"> This line would not have any underline
            because this belongs to nà¤¦line class. </p>
        <p>The first line of this paragraph will be underlined
            as defined in the CSS rule above. Rest of the lines in this
            paragraph will remain normal. This example shows how to use
            :first-line pseduo element to give effect to the first line
            of any HTML element. </p>
    </body>
