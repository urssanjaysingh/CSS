<!-- A property called visibility allows you to hide an element from view. You can use
this property along with JavaScript to create very complex menu and very
complex webpage layouts.
You may choose to use the visibility property to hide error messages that are
only displayed if the user needs to see them, or to hide answers to a quiz until
the user selects an option.
NOTE: Remember that the source code will still contain whatever is in the
invisible paragraph, so you should not use this to hide sensitive information such
as credit card details or passwords. -->
