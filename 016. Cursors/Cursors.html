<!-- The cursor property of CSS allows you to specify the type of cursor that should
be displayed to the user.
One good usage of this property is in using images for submit buttons on forms.
By default, when a cursor hovers over a link, the cursor changes from a pointer
to a hand. However, it does not change form for a submit button on a form.
Therefore, whenever someone hovers over an image that is a submit button, it
provides a visual clue that the image is clickable.

NOTE: You should try to use only these values to add helpful information for
users, and in places, they would expect to see that cursor. For example, using
the crosshair when someone hovers over a link can confuse the visitors. -->
