<!-- CSS gives you an opportunity to create layers of various divisions. The CSS
layers refer to applying the z-index property to elements that overlap with each
other.
The z-index property is used along with the position property to create an effect
of layers. You can specify which element should come on top and which element
should come at bottom.
A z-index property can help you to create more complex webpage layouts. The
following example shows how to create layers in CSS. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>

    <head>
        <title>Layers</title>

        width: 300px;
        height: 100px;
        position: relative;
        top: 10px;
        left: 80px;
        z-index: 2">
