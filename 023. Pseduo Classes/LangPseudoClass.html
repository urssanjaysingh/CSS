<!-- The language pseudo-class :lang, allows constructing selectors based on the
language setting for specific tags.

This class is useful in documents that must appeal to multiple languages that
have different conventions for certain language constructs. For example, the
French language typically uses angle brackets (< and >) for quoting purposes,
while the English language uses quote marks (' and ').

In a document that needs to address this difference, you can use the :lang
pseudo-class to change the quote marks appropriately. The following code
changes the <blockquote> tag appropriately for the language being used: -->
