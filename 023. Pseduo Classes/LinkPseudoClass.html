<!-- CSS pseudo-classes are used to add special effects to some selectors. You do
not need to use JavaScript or any other script to use those effects. A simple
syntax of pseudo-classes is as follows:
    selector: pseudo-class {property: value}
CSS classes can also be used with pseudo-classes:
    selector. class: pseudo-class {property: value} -->

<!-- The following example demonstrates how to use :link class to set the link color.
Possible values could be any color name in any valid format. -->
