<!-- The :first-child pseudo-class matches a specified element that is the first child of
another element and adds special style to that element that is the first child of
some other element.
For example, to indent the first paragraph of all <div> elements, you could use
this definition: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <head>
        <title>First Child Pseudo Class</title>
        <style type="text/css">
            div>p:first-child {
                text-indent: 25px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <div>
            <p>
                First paragraph in div. This paragraph will be indented
            </p>
            <p>
                Second paragraph in div. This paragraph will not be indented
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>But it will not match the paragraph in this HTML: </p>
        <div>
            <h3>Heading</h3>
            <p>
                The first paragraph inside the div.
                This paragraph will not be effected.
            </p>
        </div>
    </body>

</html>
